    "New York City is the largest city in the United States with long history of international immigration. This final project explores the best locations for African restaurants throughout the Bronx of New York. New York is the most populous city in the United States with more than 8.4 million (Quick Facts, 2018) people. Over 3 million of New York Cityâ€™s residents are foreign-born; over one-quarter arrived in 2000 or later. They came from many parts of the world.The Black nonhispanic population of New York City numbered 1.89 million in 2014, more than double the count in any other U.S. city At the 2010 U.S. Census, there were 1,385,108 people residing in Bronx, an increase of 3.9% since 2000. The U.S. Census considers the Bronx to be the most diverse area in the country. There is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents, chosen at random, would be of different race or ethnicity. With it's diverse culture , comes diverse food items. There are many resturants in bronx, each belonging to different categories like Chinese , Indian , French etc. According to a 2013 Census Bureau estimate, 45.8% of the Bronx's population was white, 43.3% was black or African American, 4.2% Asian, 3.0% American Indian, 0.4% Pacific Islander, and 3.3% of two or more races. In addition, 54.6% of the population was of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race."
